# Ryu's Conquest

## Inspiration

Once upon a time, a village is invaded by an army of malevolent robots. Upon leaving, they took away the most valuable things in the world, games. While the inhabitants of the village were filled with sadness, a brave warrior named Ryu has decided to step up and go on a quest to bring back the games. To do that, he need to beat the robots in four famous games on planet Xamos, Opus, Icrozar and Duex, respectively. Let’s see if he can beat the robots!

## What it does

Web Application drive you through retro games one by one in order of increasing difficulties.

## How we built it

Application has been designed using elementary tools of Web Development like HTML,CSS and JavaScript to design the Frontend. All the games have been developed using JavaScript and jQuery.

## Challenges we ran into



## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were successful in developing a Web Application and feel pride in bringing our thoughts to reality. It was a golden opportunity to network with people from different time zones coming together to develop a project.

## What we learned

We got a lot of exposure in Game Development using JavaScript. Also we documented our project on GitHub ensuring best practices are followed. 

## What's next for Ryu's Conquest

We believe that this Project possesses tremendous potential and can be taken forward. Time Clock can be added along with escalation in game difficulties. Also we need not restrict to only 4 planets and incorporate new games spanning numerous categories. As a future work we can work upon adding multiplayer and chat capabilities to enhance robustness of the project.
